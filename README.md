# IntroDB
Code used in my introduction to databases class 
This code was used in the course DSA-230: Database Systems.
It was an introduction to database concepts and design.
We also covered creating and maniplulating databases with SQL, which
is shown in these files.
I could not find the project descriptions, but they are all focused on 
creating a database, entering the data, and then manipulating the data.
This is coded using mySQL.
